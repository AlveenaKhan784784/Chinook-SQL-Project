# Chinook-SQL-Project-1

#### This project explores the Chinook music store database using SQL queries written and executed in **MySQL**. The Chinook database simulates a digital media store with tables like `Customer`, `Invoice`, `Track`, `Genre` etc, making it a great resource for learning and practicing SQL queries for data analysis.

# Chinook-SQL-Project-2

#### This project continues exploring the Chinook music store database using SQL queries written and executed in MySQL. The Chinook database replicates a digital media store environment with tables like Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Employee, and Genre‚Äîmaking it an ideal dataset for real-world SQL data analysis scenarios.

| `queries2_results.sql`       | Markdown-formatted results/output of each query       |

## üí° How to Use

1. Download the Chinook database in MySQL format:  
   üîó [Chinook Database GitHub](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)  
   *(Check `ChinookDatabase/DataSources/` for MySQL scripts)*

2. Import the database into your MySQL server using a tool like **MySQL Workbench** or **phpMyAdmin**.

3. Open `chinook_queries2.sql` and run the queries.

4. View the results in `queries2_results.sql` or execute your own versions for practice.

## ‚ùì Questions Explored

- What is the total revenue by each media type?
- Which invoice has the lowest total amount?
- How many invoices were created in each year?
- What is the average purchase amount by country?
- How does the revenue vary by billing city?
- How many customers are supported by each employee?
- Which customers have made purchases in multiple months?
- Which customers have the highest number of tracks purchased?

## üõ† Tools & Skills Used

- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tool:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Skills:** `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `HAVING`, aggregate functions, subqueries, date functions

## Conclusion
Through this project, I practiced real-world SQL queries using the Chinook database. Project 1 builds a strong foundation with common queries, while Project 2 dives into deeper analysis like revenue trends and customer behavior. This two-part approach helped reinforce both basic and advanced SQL skills using a structured, business-oriented dataset.
