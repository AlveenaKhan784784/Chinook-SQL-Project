# Chinook-SQL-Project

#### This project explores the Chinook music store database using SQL queries written and executed in **MySQL**. The Chinook database simulates a digital media store with tables like `Customer`, `Invoice`, `Track`, `Genre` etc, making it a great resource for learning and practicing SQL queries for data analysis.

## Files Included

| File Name             | Description                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `chinook_queries.sql` | Contains all SQL queries executed using MySQL |
| `queries_results.sql` | Markdown-formatted results for each query     |

## How to Use

1. Download the Chinook database in MySQL format:  
ðŸ”— https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database (check `/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/` for MySQL scripts)

2. Import the Chinook database into your MySQL server using a tool like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin.

3. Open `chinook_queries.sql` and execute the queries.

4. View query results in `queries_results.sql` or generate your own.

## Questions Explored

- How many customers are there?
- Who are the top 5 customers by spending?
- What are the monthly sales totals?
- Which invoice had the highest total?
- What is the most popular music genre?
- How many customers are there per country?
- List customers ordered by country.
- Which invoices have a total greater than $20?
- Which 3 tracks were sold the most?

## Tools & Skills Used

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tool**: MySQL Workbench
- **Skills**: SELECT, Aggregate Functions, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, Date formatting

## Conclusion
Through this project, I improved my understanding of SQL operations using real-world-like data. It helped me practice writing aggregation queries, joins, and ordering logic to extract meaningful insights from relational databases. The Chinook database offered a structured and practical way to simulate business scenarios for data querying.
